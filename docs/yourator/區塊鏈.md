理想的候選人具有很強的邏輯思考和專案管理能力，不但在意開發的邏輯細節，還能以宏觀角度與不同職能的夥伴討論產品方向，能夠在瞬息萬變的環境中快速取得進展，同時卻也有辦法深思熟慮做出決策。另外，也希望他對於新技術的應用具有高度的好奇心，高機率會是個新產品上市時的早期採用者，並且也會追蹤產品開發趨勢（e.g. 會 follow iOS design guideline updates）。
在 AIFIAN 擔任產品經理的感覺會是如何？

參與產品初期建立的流程，你將對於產品方向及開發流程造就影響力。
組織非常扁平，在這裡你不會只是個齒輪或螺絲釘，而是如同馬達一般去驅動團隊，你負責的專案就真的是「你的」，你會像是該專案的 mini-ceo，根據產品願景去思考和建構目標，並推進開發落實。
在產品功能規劃初期，就會有工程與設計資源共同協助規格方向的收斂，並且我們採用敏捷式開發流程，擁抱各種設計思考工具的導入，透過小步快跑的精神，進行專案可行性的實驗。

 
你將主要協作的對象：

產品團隊：產品經理、產品設計師及客服
跨部門合作對象：軟體工程師、執行長及策略長

 
你需要負責的工作內容

依據不同候選人過往的經歷和期待，負責的目標範疇會有所不同，主要分為：系統功能 / 用戶成長 / App 功能。
根據所負責的範疇，撰寫詳細的 PRD、提供明確的專案 scope 細節與目標，管理產品開發專案時程，與工程團隊和產品設計師一同推進專案的落實。
探索及提出產品優化方向和新功能想法，協助迭代 roadmap 規劃，實現產品願景。
能夠 peer review 其他產品經理的專案，主動給予反饋和觀點，協助產品團隊其他夥伴成長。
能夠跳脫舊有的流程，不被過往的框架所侷限，與工程團隊持續追求更有效率的開發流程。
其他條件
如果具備下列的經歷和能力，也許你會很適合這個角色：

熟悉產品開發流程，理解基礎工程語言與概念，如果有工程背景或經驗就更好了！
具有獨立規劃 mobile/web app 專案，執行用戶體驗研究與測試，並與跨職能的團隊（包含工程師及設計師）協作將產品帶上線的經驗。
對數據敏感，能夠通過數據發現問題，分析問題，並提出解決方案。
至少熟悉一種類型專案的規劃與實作：用戶成長、以流量為主的專案 / 外部系統串接 / 後台建立 / 區塊鏈技術應用 / mobile app 功能（Android & iOS）

我們會很高興你有：

規劃及實際跑過 design sprint，或其他設計思考相關流程。
實際理解區塊鏈技術及其可運用的場景。
